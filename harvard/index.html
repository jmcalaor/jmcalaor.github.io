<p>I spent two summers at Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA working with Dr. Martha Hoopes. The long-term project of the research team at Harvard Farm investigates how grassland management regimes influence plant communities. My indivdiual project explored facilitative ability of nitrogen-fixing clovers (Trifolium species).</p>

<p>I worked at Harvard Farm, an approximately 70-acre piece of grassland. Formerly a golf course, the land has become a meadow and is vulnerable to further reforestation by succession processes. While this might sound great, New England grasslands are becoming rare and the organisms that depend on them are threatened. So, management regimes are implemented to maintain grasslands. The long-term effects of these regimes on the plant communities, however, are not quite understood. This is where the research team came in! We aimed to understand the long-term effects of grassland managements on the dynamics of the community with emphasis on invasion.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in the effects of mowing and grazing. We had three areas on the farm maintained by either mowing, constant grazing, or rotational grazing. In these areas are permanent plots which we survey twice yearly for what plant species are present and note how much of the plot the species cover. We are interested in how these plots differ by treatment and throughout the years.</p>

<p>Increased nitrogen levels allows increased growth for both native and non-native plants in isolation; however, nitrogen-enriched soils may alter competitive interactions and increase success only for strong nitrogen competitors. Invasive non-native species are often disproportionately able to capitalize on resource-rich soils. Once established, invasive species may further modify communities through allelopathy or other alterations of soil conditions that impact native species. Through this process, nitrogen-fixing non-natives may facilitate invasional meltdown. So, I explored the role of the nonnative <em>Trifolium</em> species in community alteration at Harvard Farm through census of paired plots with and without clovers and a greenhouse experiment.</p>
