My first introduction to formal research was with Dr. Christopher Lobban at the University of Guam. We worked with a group of diatoms that were historically messy in taxonomy, Nitzschia. Within this group are conopeate species. We used a scanning-electron microscope to detect ultrastructural variation in this subset. From morphological differences, we named and described 14 new species, primarily from Guam and one from Costa Rica." />

<p><em>Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program - Summer 2015</em></p>
<p>My first introduction to formal research was with Dr. Christopher Lobban at the University of Guam. We worked with a group of diatoms that were historically messy in taxonomy, <em>Nitzschia</em>. Within this group are conopeate species. We used a scanning-electron microscope to detect ultrastructural variation in this subset. From morphological differences, we named and described 14 new species, primarily from Guam and one from Costa Rica.</p>
<p>This was the first time I saw a project through and is my <a href="">first publication</a>. The results from this summer were also my first presentation at a national conference, the 2015 AISES Conference, where I won 5th place in student presentations. This experience got me excited about scientific research and sent me on my journey to the scientist I am today.</p>
