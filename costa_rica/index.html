<p><em>Native American and Pacific Islander Research Experience (NAPIRE) Program - Summer 2016</em></p>
<p>As part of the NAPIRE Program, I worked with Dr. Szymek Drobniak to understand the effects of fragmentation on bird coloration. Forest fragmentation has increased with expanding agriculture and can have effects on biodiversity. We were interested in how habitat characteristics of these fragments might influence coloration. We hypothesized that fragment size and edge characteristics might be an important characteristic with the idea that sexual selection might drive birds in smaller fragments to be more brightly colored than their counterparts in larger fragments.</p>
<p>We used mist nets to catch birds in fragments near the Las Cruces Biological Station. We carefully removed birds from nets, collected feathers, and released the birds. We took collected feathers back to the lab and used a spectrophotometer to quantify coloration. We found that differences in coloration were not correlated with fragment size but variation could be explained by complexity in forest edge - the more complex the forest edge, the more brightly colored.</p>
